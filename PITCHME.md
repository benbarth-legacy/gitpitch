## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is an OSS statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and Native. It‚Äôs developed by JetBrains. The project started in 2010 and was open source from very early on. The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016.

## Is Kotlin an object-oriented language or a functional one?

Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional constructs. You can use it in both OO and FP styles, or mix elements of the two. With first-class support for features such as higher-order functions, function types and lambdas, Kotlin is a great choice if you‚Äôre doing or exploring functional programming.

## What advantages does Kotlin give me over the Java programming language?

Kotlin is more concise. Rough estimates indicate approximately a 40% cut in the number of lines of code. It‚Äôs also more type-safe, e.g. support for non-nullable types makes applications less prone to NPE‚Äôs. Other features including smart casting, higher-order functions, extension functions and lambdas with receivers provide the ability to write expressive code as well as facilitating creation of DSL.

## Is Kotlin compatible with the Java programming language?

Yes. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language and major emphasis has been placed on making sure that your existing codebase can interact properly with Kotlin. You can easily call Kotlin code from Java and Java code from Kotlin. This makes adoption much easier and lower-risk. There‚Äôs also an automated Java-to-Kotlin converter built into the IDE that simplifies migration of existing code.

## What can I use Kotlin for?

Kotlin can be used for any kind of development, be it server-side, client-side web and Android. With Kotlin/Native currently in the works, support for other platforms such as embedded systems, macOS and iOS is coming. People are using Kotlin for mobile and server-side applications, client-side with JavaScript or JavaFX, and data science, just to name a few possibilities.
